## Professional Projects

### Automated CV based Quality Control
In manufacturing industries it is very important to check the quality of the goods being produced for a variety of reasons but doing this manually is a hassle. Understanding this problem, we developed an automated, highly efficient deep learning model architecture which trains the model on ground for a specific product using very few good images. The system can be implemented on any manufacturing line from products vaying from as small as a screw to as big as bulk metallic containers provided that the good view of the object is captured.

### Intelligent Resume Screener
In large organizations, a lot of candidates apply for jobs everyday for different positions. When there is a requirement for a certain post, HRs go through their entire database of resumes to filter the right set of candidates. This is a painfull process and requires considerably months together of time. We developed a product which understands the requirement for a particullar job position, analyze each resume like a human woukld do and ranks all the resumes based on their relevance for the offered position. Now from this the HR team can choose the top N candidates which they'd want to reach out and start the interview process. This is a fair system which saves HR's time and values the candidate's worthiness for the role.

### Video surveillance for ATMs
As the technology is growing so are the ways to manipulate them as well and a very common example of this is the ATM card skimming. We developed a computer vision based surveillance system to monitor the ATM machine and interpret for any skimming activities and send alert messages to the central system. All ATMs will have camera by default and this monitoring tool can be deployed on lightwight systems like RaspberryPi.
