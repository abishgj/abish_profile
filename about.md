Hey! This is Abish Jayaram

Have you ever wondered why we behave the way we do ?

I did for sure and that's always in me at every situation that has happened or happening. Luckily, my profession is very close to my way of thinking in life. I try to understand the human way of thinking and try to replicate that to a machine. Basically, I teach machines how to think and interpret situations in human way.
